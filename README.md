High fidelity prototype of a music streaming app.

Made to illustrate responsive design.

## Process

- Look investigate "competitors"
- Gather inspiration for visual style
- Decided on retro-futuristic/synthwave look
- Draw low-fidelity/wireframe on paper for mobile layout
- Code high-fidelity prototype with flutter for mobile
- Extract widgets so they can be used as building blocks for other device types
- Add responsive breakpoints for our target device types (mobile, table and desktop)
- Add scaffold for tablet with `NavigationRail` instead of `BottomNavigationBar`
- Add scaffold for desktop with now playing panel
